# uni-modules

Raycast extension which provides list of modules for easy navigation.

## Usage (Blackboard)

Copy and paste the content of the `module_scraper.js` into the JavaScript console whilst viewing the Modules page. Hit enter, and copy the result into the `modules.ts` file, overwriting the template modules.

## Remarks

The code is specialised to me so will have to be considerably changed to fit other course/year structures and modules.
